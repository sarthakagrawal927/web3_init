# Smart Contracts

To Test the code

```bash
npm i
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

Hardhat will create a test network, deploy the contracts & test & destroy the network.

```bash
npx hardhat node
// to run the scripts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-hello.ts --network localhost
```

Got bored, decided to continue the [course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web3-smart-contracts) at a later point.
